## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I took an approach where I first start in the middle of the array, and the check that index for the valueToFind, after which, depending or not if I am higher or lower, I will search  the next quarter of the array, until I find my solution.
