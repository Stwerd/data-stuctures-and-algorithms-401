Challenge Setup & Execution

Branch Name: graph-breadth-first

Challenge Type: Extending an Implementation
Feature Tasks

Write the following method for the Graph class:

    breadth first
    Arguments: Node
    Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
    Display the collection

Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
